# Something Awful Smilies JSON for Guilded

I got tired of having to manually import all 1176 Smilies from the Forums of Something Awful by hand into Guilded

So I build this collection of "packs" for all the smilies in Something Awful Forums.

# Installation

1. Host this JSON file somewhere public and share it with users.
2. Emote names must only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (a-z, 0-9, _). The emote url needs to point to a publicly-accessible image that is under 256kb in size. Each emote pack can have up to 30 emotes.
 
3. Then you can paste it into Guilded by copying the location where the packs are located into Settings > Emotes > Import an external emote pack
4. Paste a link to the emote pack you want to import


Example: 
If the URL where you copied the emote packs to looks like this: https://server.domain.name/packs/sa_smilies-1.json or https://server.ip.address/packs/sa_smilies-1&type=json

Then copy that url into the space provided in guilded and it will automatically upload the pack you linked.  Each pack contains 30 smilies, so if you wanted to add all 1176 Smilies you need to do this 40 times. :P
